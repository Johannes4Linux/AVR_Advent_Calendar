# AVR Advent Calendar

## About

In this repository I will host the code for my AVR Advent calendar. You can learn how to use the most important interfaces of the AVR 8-bit microcontrollers in 24 days. Even if it is not Advent, this repository can be used as a tutorial to learn how to code with AVR 8-bit microcontrollers.

## What you need

- Atmega Microcontroller (e.g. Atmega48, Atmega88, Atmega168, Atmega328)
- Attiny44 microcontroller
- three LEDs (green, yellow, red)
- three 480 Ohm resistors
- push button for breadboard
- four 10kOhm resistors
- 7 segment display
- 74HC595 Shift Register Serial In, Parallel Out
- 74HC165 Shift Register Parallel In, Serial Out
- 20 MHz Crystal
- LM75A temperature sensor board
- Breadboard
- Wires
- Potentiometer 10kOhm
- DIP Switch (at least 4 positions)

If you already own a Raspberry Pi, you can use it to program the AVR controllers and use the interfaces to interact with it (UART, I2C, SPI, ...). In case you don't own a RPi and you don't want to buy one, you need the following items to follow my tutorial:

- USBASP programmer
- UART to USB converter
